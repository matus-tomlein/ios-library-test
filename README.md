# Sample Objective-C library with SPM and CocoaPods

This is a demo of a simple library written in Objective-C that can be included in projects using Swift Package Manager or using CocoaPods.

There are also two example apps. One includes the library through CocoaPods and the other through Swift Package Manager.

The CI builds the library and runs the tests under different configurations of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
